Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. This project focuses on building a machine-learning model to detect breast cancer using diagnostic data to assist in early detection and improve outcomes.

Features

Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

Implementation of supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).

Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization of key results and insights.

Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Description: The dataset contains diagnostic features computed from breast cancer cell images, labeled as benign or malignant.
